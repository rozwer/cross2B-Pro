description: Use when answering LangGraph questions. Prefer reading local project code/specs; fetch docs only if needed.

## Workflow

1. Search this repo for the relevant symbol/config.
2. Prefer `仕様書/` as source-of-truth for product requirements.
3. If still unclear, consult upstream LangGraph docs (only the necessary pages).

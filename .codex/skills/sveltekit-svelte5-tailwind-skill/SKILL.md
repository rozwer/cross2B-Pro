## Checklist

1. Confirm versions (SvelteKit major, Svelte 5 runes, Tailwind v4).
2. Keep component boundaries clear (server load vs client interactivity).
3. Use Tailwind utilities consistently; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
4. Validate build output after config changes.
5. Prefer small component files and predictable props/events.

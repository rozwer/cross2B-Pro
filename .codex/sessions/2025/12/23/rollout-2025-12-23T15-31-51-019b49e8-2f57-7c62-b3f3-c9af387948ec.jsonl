Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- Skill Creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- codex: Use when operating Codex CLI itself (config, profiles, sandbox, approvals, and safe usage patterns). (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/codex/SKILL.md)\n- codex-reviewer: Use when running Codex as an independent reviewer. Focus on actionable, prioritized findings. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/codex-reviewer/SKILL.md)\n- container-debugging: Use for Docker/Kubernetes issues. Inspect runtime state and logs before changing images/manifests. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/container-debugging/SKILL.md)\n- debugger: Use when the root cause is unclear. Trace the failure back through the call stack and isolate the first bad state. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/debugger/SKILL.md)\n- debugging-with-tools: Use for investigation-heavy work. Prefer tool-driven evidence (search, logs, diffs) before changing code. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/debugging-with-tools/SKILL.md)\n- gemini-peer-review: Use when you want a second-opinion review from a different model/tool. Provide narrow, reviewable diffs. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/gemini-peer-review/SKILL.md)\n- langgraph-builder: Use when creating a new LangGraph graph. Start with a minimal graph and iterate. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/langgraph-builder/SKILL.md)\n- langgraph-docs: Use when answering LangGraph questions. Prefer reading local project code/specs; fetch docs only if needed. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/langgraph-docs/SKILL.md)\n- langgraph-patterns-expert: Use for LangGraph agent design and refactors. Prefer explicit state, small nodes, and clear transitions. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/langgraph-patterns-expert/SKILL.md)\n- mobile-debugging: Use for React Native / Expo troubleshooting (Metro bundler, native modules, simulator/emulator issues). (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/mobile-debugging/SKILL.md)\n- nextjs-skills: Use for Next.js design/architecture work. Respect App Router boundaries and server/client separation. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/nextjs-skills/SKILL.md)\n- plan: Plan lifecycle management for Codex plans stored in $CODEX_HOME/plans (default ~/.codex/plans). Use when a user asks to create, find, read, update, delete, or manage plan documents for implementation work or overview/reference documentation. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/.system/plan/SKILL.md)\n- providers: Use when integrating multiple LLM providers. Keep provider-specific code isolated behind a small interface. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/providers/SKILL.md)\n- sveltekit-svelte5-tailwind-skill: Use for SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 + Tailwind v4 projects. Keep SSR/client boundaries and Tailwind config consistent. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/sveltekit-svelte5-tailwind-skill/SKILL.md)\n- systematic-debugging: Use for bugs/test failures. Reproduce, isolate root cause, fix, and validate with evidence. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md)\n- tailwind-css: Use when implementing Tailwind CSS styling. Prefer utility-first composition and responsive patterns. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/tailwind-css/SKILL.md)\n- tailwind-v4: Use when working on Tailwind v4. Watch for deprecated utilities and updated configuration patterns. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/tailwind-v4/SKILL.md)\n- validating-openai-api-implementations: Use to review OpenAI API integrations for correctness (endpoints, params, auth, response handling) and robustness. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/validating-openai-api-implementations/SKILL.md)\n- web-artifacts-builder: Use when generating or refactoring UI artifacts. Prefer modular components and consistent styling. (file: /home/rozwer/案件/.codex/skills/web-artifacts-builder/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"exec","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"8d3ed8120b01f22be3575551e352773359bf178e","branch":"develop","repository_url":"git@github.com:rozwer/cross2B-Pro.git"}}}

Contains a LangGraph agent intended for local exploration and LangGraph Cloud deployment.\n  - `langgraph-example/my_agent/`: Python package with the graph (`agent.py`) and utilities (`utils/`).\n  - `langgraph-example/static/`: Assets used by the example (e.g., screenshots).\n  - `langgraph-example/.env.example`: Template for required environment variables.\n- `仕様書/`: Product and technical specifications (Japanese). Treat as source-of-truth for requirements.\n- `ref/`: Reference artifacts and step outputs (JSON/MD/HTML) generated during prior runs.\n\n## Setup, Build, and Run\n\nThis repo is Python-first; there is no global build system.\n\nCommon local flow (from `langgraph-example/`):\n\n```bash\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npip install -r my_agent/requirements.txt\ncp .env.example .env  # fill in keys\n```\n\n- If you use LangGraph Studio / CLI, point it at `langgraph-example/langgraph.json` to load the `agent` graph.\n- Deployment targets LangGraph Cloud; follow the upstream LangGraph Cloud docs referenced in `langgraph-example/README.md`.\n\n## Coding Style & Naming\n\n- Python code lives under `langgraph-example/my_agent/`.\n- Use 4‑space indentation, type hints where practical, and keep functions small and single‑purpose.\n- Prefer descriptive snake_case names for functions/variables and PascalCase for classes (see `AgentState`, `GraphConfig`).\n- Avoid adding new top‑level scripts unless necessary; extend `my_agent/utils/` for shared logic.\n\n## Testing\n\nNo automated tests are currently present. If adding tests, place them under `langgraph-example/tests/` and name files `test_*.py`. Use `pytest` unless there is a strong reason to choose another framework.\n\n## Commit & Pull Requests\n\n- Commits so far use short, imperative messages (often Japanese), e.g., `環境構築`. Keep messages concise and task‑focused.\n- PRs should include: purpose/summary, linked spec or issue (if any), and notes on how to run or validate changes. Add screenshots when changing UI/assets under `static/`.\n\n## Configuration & Secrets\n\n- Never commit real API keys. Use `.env` locally and keep it untracked; update `.env.example` if new variables are required.\n\n## Codex CLI (project-local)\n\n- This repo includes a project-local Codex home under `.codex/`.\n- To use it (so skills/config are loaded from this repo), run: `source .codex/env.sh` before starting `codex`.\n- Codex skills live under `.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md`.\n\n## Operating Rules (for agents)\n\n- Write internal reasoning in English; write final user-facing answers in Japanese.\n- Keep a concise work log in `AGENTS_history.md`.\n- Update this `AGENTS.md` frequently when working conventions change.\n- Use `skills.md` when appropriate (e.g., to align capabilities, conventions, or reusable procedures).\n\n@AGENTS_history.md\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from ~/.codex/skills; each entry shows name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.
